A is the first to discover the opportunity and immediately recruits B1, B2, and B3; B1 further recruits C1 and C2; B2 has no subordinates; B3 recruits the strong C3. On the second day, B1's valid bets are 500, B2's valid bets are 3,000, B3's valid bets are 2,000, C1's valid bets are 1,000, C2's valid bets are 2,000, and C3's valid bets reach 20,000.",

Summary:</strong><ul><li><strong>(1) Direct Team:</strong> Refers to the direct subordinates recruited by A, i.e., the direct relationship with A, collectively referred to as the direct team.</li><li><strong>(2) Other Teams:</strong> Refers to the subordinates recruited by A's subordinates, which are beyond the other relationship with A, i.e., subordinates of subordinates, subordinates of subordinates of subordinates, and so on, collectively referred to as other teams; because this agency model can recruit subordinates infinitely, for the sake of explanation, this article only takes a 2-tier structure as an example.</li><li><strong>(3) Explanation of A:</strong> A's direct performance is 5,500 and another performance is 20,000 (due to the strong performance of C3), with a total performance of 28,500, corresponding to a commission rate of 3%. Since B1's total performance is 3,000, only enjoying a 1% commission, while A's total performance is 28500, enjoying a 3% commission rate, there is a tier differential between A and B1, the difference being: 3% - 1% = 2%, this difference is the part contributed by C1 and C2 to A, so C1 and C2 contribute to A: (1,000+2,000) * 2% = 60, there is no tier differential between A and B3, so C3 contributes no commission to A.</li><li><strong>(4) Explanation of B1:</strong> B1 has subordinates C1 and C2, with a direct performance of 3,000, corresponding to a commission rate of 1%.</li><li><strong>(5) Explanation of B2:</strong> B2 may be lazy and not recruit subordinates, thus no income.</li><li><strong>(6) Explanation of B3:</strong> Although B3 joined late and belongs to A's subordinate, its subordinate C3 is strong, with a direct performance of 20,000, allowing B3 to directly enjoy a higher commission rate of 3%.</li><li><strong>(7) Rule Summary:</strong> Regardless of when you join, under whose subordinate, and no matter what level you are in, your income is never affected. You no longer suffer from the losses of others' subordinates, and your recruitment is not restricted. This is a fair and just agency model, and joining late does not mean you will always be at the bottom.</li></ul></li></ul>"

The higher the difficulty, the greater the reward.<br/>Rewards can be claimed directly once the conditions are met. They can be claimed on either Android or iOS platforms. Expired rewards will be void (i.e., unclaimed rewards are considered voluntarily forfeited).<br/>Due to the high bonus amount offered in this task, the bonus requires a {15}-times turnover (i.e., audit, wagering, or valid bets) before withdrawal. Wagering is not limited to any specific gaming platform.<br/>This task is restricted to normal manual operations by the account holder only. Renting accounts, using external tools, bots, betting across accounts, mutual betting, arbitrage, exploiting system loopholes, group control, or other technical methods are strictly prohibited. Violations may result in the cancellation or deduction of rewards, account freezing, or blacklisting.<br/>To avoid misinterpretations, the platform reserves the right of final explanation for this event.",
